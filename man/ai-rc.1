.SH NAME
ai-rc \- Generate OpenStack environment variables

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ai-rc [OPTION]... \fI--same-project-as HOST\fR | [OS_PROJECT]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
ai-rc is a tool which generates the environment variables used to interact with the OpenStack
service via command line. Setting these variables in your terminal will allow you to use the
"openstack" CLI and also "ai-bs-vm" and "ai-kill-vm" to create and destroy puppetized VMs,
respectively.
.LP
Users can provide direcly the name of the OpenStack project they want to generate environment
variables for as a positional argument. Alternatively, using option
.B [-s|--same-project-as]
followed by a hostname will
generate variables for the project this host belongs to.

In addition to these two optional arguments, 'ai-rc'
can also be run without providing any, in which case variables for the user's personal
project will be printed.
Please note that in most cases you would like to evaluate the output returned by 'ai-rc'
e.g.
.B eval $(ai-rc *options)
