.SH NAME
ai-bs-vm \- Command-line tool to create Puppetized OpenStack VMs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ai-bs-vm"
.B pet|cattle
\fIvmname\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
ai-bs-vm is a shell script that helps to create Puppet-managed Foreman-enabled OpenStack VMs.
.PP
Foreman registration is performed by the VM itself when it
boots for the first time. Therefore it will show up in the selected
hostgroup \fBafter\fR the first boot. An email will be sent to the
owner of the box after a successful registration.
.PP
Current officially supported images are: SLC6 Server and SLC5 Server.
.PP
.I Prerequisites:
.TP
.B Foreman username
You must have logged into Foreman at least once \fBbefore\fR creating
your first virtual machine with the same username you're executing
this script (shell user)
.TP
.B Openstack credentials
Your Openstack credentials are in place (get an \fBopenrc.sh\fR from
Openstack Horizon and source it)
.TP
.B Group membership
You are member of \fBai-admins\fR e-group (otherwise the host staging will
fail, the box won't get a host certificate and therefore Puppet won't
run)
