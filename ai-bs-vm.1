.SH NAME
ai-bs-vm \- Command-line tool to create Puppetized OpenStack VMs

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ai-bs-vm"
[vmname]

.SH DESCRIPTION
ai-bs-vm is a shell script that helps to create Puppet-managed Foreman-enabled OpenStack VMs.
.LP
If no VM name is specified a random hostname will be generated
based on a trimmed SHA1 hashed UNIX timestamp. The length is
limited to 60 characters (prefix included).

.LP
Foreman registration is performed by the VM itself when it
boots for the first time. Therefore it will show up in the selected
hostgroup \fBafter\fR the first boot. An email will be sent to the
owner of the box after a successful registration.
.LP
Current officially supported images are: SLC6 Server and SLC5 Server.
.LP
.I Prerequisites:
.TP
.B OpenStack credentials
Your OpenStack credentials are in place (get an \fBopenrc.sh\fR from
OpenStack Horizon and source it). By doing this you will set the OpenStack
instance you want to use and the tenant for your VM. More info:
http://cern.ch/go/V7T7
.TP
.B Foreman username
You must have logged into Foreman at least once \fBbefore\fR creating
your first virtual machine with the same username you used to log into
OpenStack to get your credentials.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The behaviour of the tool can be customized by the following
environment variables:
.LP
.I Mandatory variables:
.TP
.B AIBS_HOSTGROUP_NAME
Name of the Foreman hostgroup where you want your new virtual
machine to land. It \fBmust have spare as tip\fP (e.g. "spare",
"lxbatch/spare", "mycoolhostgroup/spare"). Reusing the common
"spare" is fine if you don't need to apply any special configuration
right after the machine shows up. If you want to use your own spare
please \fBmake sure that the hostgroup exists before creating your
virtual machine\fP. If it doesn't, just create it. [string]

.LP
.I Optional variables:
.TP
.B AIBS_ENVIRONMENT_NAME
Name of the Foreman environment you want your new virtual
machine to join
[string] (defaults to "production")
.TP
.B AIBS_LANDB_RESPONSIBLE
E-group name to be set as responsible in LANDB. If not specified
the user creating the VM is set as responsible (Grizzly and onwards
only).
.TP
.B AIBS_LANDB_MAINUSER
E-group name to be set as main user in LANDB. If not specified
the user creating the VM is set as main user (Grizzly and onwards
only).
.TP
.B AIBS_LANDB_RESPONSIBLE
E-group name to be set as responsible in LANDB
.TP
.B AIBS_SECURITYGROUPS_LIST
List of security groups your VM will belong to
[comma-separed list of strings] (defaults to "default")
Example: default,my-security-group
.TP
.B AIBS_SSHKEY_NAME
Name of the SSH key to login into the machine as root in case of
disaster. Use Horizon or nova keypair-add to generate a new keypair
[string]. Because of the security implications this option has, it's
strongly recommended to avoid it. Your new VM will have the Kerberos
module enabled by default, use it to configure who has root access
to the box. See http://cern.ch/go/7qW6
.TP
.B AIBS_VMAVAILZONE_NAME
The desired availability zone for the VM
[string] (there is no default)
.TP
.B AIBS_VMFLAVOR_NAME
OpenStack flavor name of the virtual machine
[string] (defaults to "m1.small")
.TP
.B AIBS_VMIMAGE_NAME
OpenStack image name of the virtual machine
[string] (defaults to "SLC6 Server - x86_64")
.TP
.B AIBS_VMNAME_PREFIX
Prefix to prepend to the randomly generated hostname
[string] (defaults to "")
.LP
.I Other optional variables:
.TP
The following parameters are for advanced users and debugging.
.TP
Probably you won't ever have to use any of them.
.TP
.B AIBS_CASERVER_HOSTNAME
Hostname of the CA server the virtual machine will request a certificate
from [string] (defaults to "baby01.cern.ch")
.TP
.B AIBS_METAPARAMETERS_LIST
Space separated list of key=value pairs of metaparameters for nova boot (e.g
"key1=value1 key2=value2").
[string] (there is no default)
.TP
.B AIBS_PUPPETMASTER_HOSTNAME
Hostname of the Puppet master the virtual machine will request its
configuration from [string] (defaults to "lxbsp2702.cern.ch")
.TP
.B AIBS_SUSIE_HOSTNAME
Host name of the Susie service (Foreman proxy)
[string] (defaults to "aisusie.cern.ch")
.TP
.B AIBS_SUSIE_PORT
Port where Susie is listening to
[string] (defaults to "443")
.TP
.B AIBS_VMBASEUSERDATA_PATH
Path to the template to generate the user data
of the virtual machine.
[string] (defaults to "/usr/share/ai-tools/userdata/common")

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B Create a named VM with default VM parameters and register it in hostgroup "foo/spare":
AIBS_HOSTGROUP_NAME="foo/spare" ai-bs-vm higgsbox

.TP
.B Same but with custom environment:
AIBS_HOSTGROUP_NAME="foo/spare"
AIBS_ENVIRONMENT_NAME="devel" ai-bs-vm higgsbox

.TP
.B Now with personalized security groups, different VM flavor and SSH key:
AIBS_SECURITYGROUPS_LIST="default,my-sec-group" AIBS_HOSTGROUP_NAME="foo/spare"
AIBS_SSHKEY_NAME="my-key" AIBS_ENVIRONMENT_NAME="devel"
AIBS_VMFLAVOR_NAME="m1.large" ai-bs-vm higgsbox

.TP
.B Create a VM with random hostname prefixed by "foo":
AIBS_VMNAME_PREFIX="foo" AIBS_HOSTGROUP_NAME="foo/spare" ai-bs-vm
